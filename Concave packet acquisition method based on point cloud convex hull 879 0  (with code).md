#  I. Introduction 

>  Inspired by the reference [1], I tried to obtain a concave package by removing the larger area of the triangular surface on the basis of the three-dimensional convex hull (here we achieved it by specifying an area threshold). Although the final result is not very ideal haha, but here I still record it.
